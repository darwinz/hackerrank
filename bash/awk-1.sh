#Objective 
#In this challenge, we practice using the awk command for text-munging and data processing tasks.

#Resources 
#Here's a useful video on the topic:
#
#
#The awk interpreter may be used for a lot of text-munging and data-processing tasks that require some quick scripting work.

#Task 
#You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A-Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively.
#
#Your task is to identify those lines that do not contain all three scores for students.
#
#Input Format
#
#There will be no more than 10 rows of data. 
#Each line will be in the following format: 
#[Identifier][English Score][Math Score][Science Score]
#
#Output Format
#
#For each student, if one or more of the three scores is missing, display:
#
#Not all scores are available for [Identifier]
#Sample Input
#
#A 25 27 50
#B 35 75
#C 75 78 
#D 99 88 76
#Sample Output
#
#Not all scores are available for B
#Not all scores are available for C
#Explanation
#
#Only 2 scores have been provided for student B and student C.

awk '{if (NF < 4){print "Not all scores are available for "$1}}'
