#Objective 
#We now transition to some basic examples of bash scripting for the purpose of text processing and data munging. In this challenge, we practice reading and filtering an array.
#
#Resources 
#Here's a great tutorial with useful examples related to arrays in Bash.
#
#Task 
#You are given a list of countries, each on a new line. Your task is to read them into an array and then filter out (remove) all the names containing the letter 'a' or 'A'.
#
#Input Format
#
#The input format consists of a list of country names, each on a separate line. The only characters present in the country names will be upper or lower case characters and hyphens.
#
#Output Format
#
#From the given list, remove the names that contain 'a' or 'A' in them. If there are no names left after removing these characters, you should display a blank line.
#
#Sample Input
#
#Namibia
#Nauru
#Nepal
#Netherlands
#NewZealand
#Nicaragua
#Niger
#Nigeria
#NorthKorea
#Norway
#Sample Output
#
#Niger
#
#Explanation
#
#Niger is the only name that does not contain an 'a' or 'A'.

while read line
do
  list=("${list[@]}" ${line})
done
echo ${list[@]/*[aA]*/}
