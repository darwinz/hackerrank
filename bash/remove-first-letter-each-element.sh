#Objective 
#In this challenge, we practice reading and transforming arrays.
#
#Resources 
#Here's a great tutorial with useful examples related to arrays in Bash.
#
#Task 
#You are given a list of countries, each on a new line. Your task is to read them into an array and then transform them in the following way:
#
#The first capital letter (if present) in each element of the array should be replaced with a dot ('.'). Then, display the entire array with a space between each country's names.
#
#Input Format
#
#The input format consists of a list of country names each on a separate line. The only characters present in the country names will be upper or lower case characters and hyphens.
#
#Output Format
#
#Transform the names as described and display the entire array of country names with a space between each of them.
#
#Sample Input

#
#Explanation
#
#The first capital letter of each name has been replaced with a dot ('.').
