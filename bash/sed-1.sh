#Objective 
#In this challenge, we will practice using the sed command to parse and transform text.
#
#Resources 
#Sed is a popular tool that enables quick parsing and transformation of text.
#
#Examples of sed in action:
#
#Substitute the first occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool':
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.
#Substitute all the occurrences of 'editor' with 'tool':
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.  
#Substitute the second occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool':
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
#My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.
#Highlight all the occurrences of 'editor' by wrapping them up in brace brackets:
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
#My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.

#Some Practical Examples
#
#Task 
#For each line in a given input file, transform the first occurrence of the word 'the' with 'this'. The search and transformation should be strictly case sensitive.
#
#Input Format
#
#A text file will be piped into your command through STDIN.
#
#Output Format
#
#Transform the text as specified by the task.
#
#Sample Input
#
#From fairest creatures we desire increase,
#That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
#But as the riper should by time decease,
#His tender heir might bear his memory:
#But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
#Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
#Making a famine where abundance lies,
#Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
#Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
#And only herald to the gaudy spring,
#Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
#And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
#Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
#To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
#When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
#And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
#Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
#Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
#Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
#Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
#To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
#Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
#How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
#If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
#Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
#Sample Output
#

#Explanation

#The line:
#
#"But as the riper should by time decease,"
#has been transformed to:
#
#"But as this riper should by time decease,"  
#The line:
#
#"To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."    
#has been transformed to:
#
#"To eat this world's due, by the grave and thee."
