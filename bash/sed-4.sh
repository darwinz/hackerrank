#Sed is a popular utility that enables quick parsing and transformation of text. Here are some basic uses for it:
#
#Substitute the first occurrence of editor with tool:
#
#$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$ echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.
#Substitute all occurrences of editor with tool:
#
#$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$ echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.  
#Substitute the second occurrence of editor with tool:
#
#$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$ echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
#My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.
#Highlight all occurrences of editor by enclosing them in curly brackets (i.e., {}):
#
#$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$ echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
#My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.
#Task
#
#Given n lines of credit card numbers, mask the first 12 digits of each credit card number with an asterisk (i.e., *) and print the masked card number on a new line. Each credit card number consists of four space-separated groups of four digits. For example, the credit card number 1234 5678 9101 1234 would be masked and printed as **** **** **** 1234.

#Some Practical Examples
#A StackOverflow question on a slightly modified version of this task where the solution involves backreferences.
#A ttuorial from TheGeekStuff detailing the use of groups and backreferences.
#Input Format
#
#Each line contains a credit card number in the form dddd dddd dddd dddd, where d denotes a decimal digit (i.e., 0 through 9). There are a total of n lines of credit card numbers.
#
#Constraints
#
#1 <= n <= 20; note that the value of n does not matter when writing your command.
#Output Format
#
#For each credit card number, print its masked version on a new line.
#
#Sample Input
#
#1234 5678 9101 1234  
#2999 5178 9101 2234  
#9999 5628 9201 1232  
#8888 3678 9101 1232  
#Sample Output
#
#**** **** **** 1234
#**** **** **** 2234
#**** **** **** 1232
#**** **** **** 1232
#Explanation
#
#Observe that the first twelve digits have been masked for each credit card number, and they are printed in the same order as they were received as input.

sed -e 's/\([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\)/**** **** **** \4/g'
