#Sed is a popular utility which enables quick parsing and transformation of text.
#
#Here are some very simple examples of sed in action.
#
#Substitute the first occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.
#Substitute all the occurrences of 'editor' with 'tool'.
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
#My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.  
#Substitute the second occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
#My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.
#Highlight all the occurrences of 'editor' by wrapping them up in brace brackets.
#
#`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
#My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.

#Task
#
#Given an input file, with N credit card numbers, each in a new line, your task is to reverse the ordering of segments in each credit card number. Assume that the credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each.
#
#If the original credit card number is 1434 5678 9101 1234, transform it to 1234 9101 5678 1434.
#
#Useful References: This particular page on StackOverflow has a relevant example about sed, groups and backreferences. Here's a detailed tutorial covering groups and backreferences.
#
#Input Format
#
#N credit card numbers, each in a new line, credit card numbers will have 4 space separated segments with 4 digits each.
#
#Constraints
#
#1 <= N <= 20
#
#However, the value of N does not matter while writing your command.
#
#Output Format
#
#N lines, each containing a credit card number with the ordering of its segments reversed.
#
#Sample Input
#
#1234 5678 9101 1234  
#2999 5178 9101 2234  
#9999 5628 9201 1232  
#8888 3678 9101 1232
#Sample Output
#
#1234 9101 5678 1234  
#2234 9101 5178 2999  
#1232 9201 5628 9999  
#1232 9101 3678 8888 
#Explanation
#
#The order of the four segments in the (input) credit card numbers have been reversed.

sed -e 's/\([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\) \([0-9]\{4\}\)/\4 \3 \2 \1/g'
