"""
Create a list, seqList, of N empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed from 0 to N-1.
The elements within each of the N sequences also use 0-indexing.
Create an integer, lastAns, and initialize it to 0.
The types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences (seqList) are described below:
1] Query: 1 . y
	1] Find the sequence, seq, at index ((x xor lastAns) % N) in seqList.
	2] Append integer y to sequence seq
2] Query: 2 . y
	1] Find the sequence, seq, at index ((x xor lastAns) % N) in seqList.
	2] Find the value of element y % size in seq (where size is the size of seq) and assign it to lastAns.
	3] Print the new value of lastAns on a new line

Task
Given N, Q, and Q queries, execute each query.

Note: (+) is the bitwise XOR operation, which corresponds to the ^ operator in most languages. Learn more about it on Wikipedia.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, N (the number of sequences) and Q (the number of queries), respectively.
Each of the Q subsequent lines contains a query in the format defined above.

Constraints
- 1 <= N, Q <= 10 ** 5
- 0 <= x <= 10 ** 9
- 0 <= y <= 10 ** 9

It is guaranteed that query type 2 will never query an empty sequence or index.
Output Format

For each type 2 query, print the updated value of lastAnswer on a new line.

Sample Input

2 5
1 0 5
1 1 7
1 0 3
2 1 0
2 1 1
Sample Output

7
3
Explanation

Initial Values:
N = 2
lastAnswer = 0

S0 = [ ]
S1 = [ ]

Query 0: Append 5 to sequence ( (0 (+) 0) % 2 ) == 0.
lastAnswer = 0
S0 = [5]
S1 = [ ]

Query 1: Append 7 to sequence ( (1 (+) 0) % 2 ) == 1.
S0 = [5]
S1 = [7]

Query 2: Append 3 to sequence ( (0 (+) 0) % 2 ) == 0.
lastAnswer = 0
S0 = [5, 3]
S1 = [7]

Query 3: Assign the value at index 0 of sequence ( (1 (+) 0) % 2 ) == 1 to lastAnswer, print lastAnswer.
lastAnswer = 7
S0 = [5, 3]
S1 = [7]

7

Query 4: Assign the value at index 1 of sequence ( (1 (+) 7) % 2 ) == 0 to lastAnswer, print lastAnswer.
lastAnswer = 3
S0 = [5, 3]
S1 = [7]

3
